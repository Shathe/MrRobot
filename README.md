# MrRobot

This github is aimed to collect all the necessary information for using the MrRobot computer of the RoPeRT group.

Every person must have an account without root privileges. The root privileges are only available on the _mrrobot_ user. 
For opening an account please ask the administrator (IÃ±igo or Ana)

Every user can install on their account whatever they consider necessary (if you have any doubts or you need help, please do not hesitate to ask for it. **Better safe than sorry**).

The most common packages and utilities are installed (shared) on the computer for all users (we are open to suggestions).
